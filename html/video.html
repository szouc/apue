        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Video Lectures</H2>

	<h3>Smile - you're on camera!</h3>

	<p>
	Starting in the Fall of 2015, where possible, lectures or parts
	thereof may be recorded and live-streamed via <a
	href="https://www.periscope.tv/">Periscope</a>.  This allows students to
	"attend" remotely or to review the lecture after the fact.  Links to the
	live broadcast are posted to the <a
	href="https://twitter.com/cs631apue">@cs631apue</a> Twitter account.
	</p>

	<p>
	(Note: there is no guarantee that any or all lectures will in fact
	be streamed or recorded, so don't miss class.)
	</p>

	<p>
	Periscope (currently) only broadcasts in portrait mode, but the
	video recordings are done intentionally
	in landscape mode.  If you are watching the live stream in the
	browser, you will see the image on its side (although on a mobile,
	you can of course just rotate the device).  This is
	unfortunate, but the primary purpose is to record the lecture and
	make it available after the fact from this website.
	</p>

	<p>
	Recordings of the lecture will be uploaded and linked to from the
	course website in the week following the lecture.
