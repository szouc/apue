        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</H2>

        <H3>Write a simple tool to perform encryption/decryption of content</H3>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>In this assignment you will write a small, standalone tool following
standard Unix conventions that performs encryption or decryption of its
input.  Even though other tools exist to accomplish this task, it is
useful to learn how to perform the basic steps to call the common crypto
library functions involved in this task.</p>

<h4>Problem assignment</h4>

<p>Write a simple program to encrypt or decrypt its input using the <a
href="http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html">AES</a> cipher.  Your
program is defined in <a href="aed.1.pdf">this manual page</a>.  As
before, your program will:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>follow the <a href="hw">general homework guidelines</a></li>
<li>be written in C (not C++ or anything else)</li>
<li>not generate any output other than error messages when
appropriate</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You may find <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue87/vinayak.html">this
link</a> and <a
href="http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption">this
link</a> useful. In addition, the <tt>EVP_EncryptInit</tt> manual page
contains code examples which you may use to build your program.

<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>

<p>You will submit a single tar archive named <em>username</em>-HW4.tar
that will extract into a directory named after your username. In that
directory will be at least a file named <tt>aed.c</tt> and a
<tt>Makefile</tt>. If you have any commentary on your submission, include
it in a file called <tt>README</tt>.</p>

<p>For example, I would submit the file <tt>jschauma-HW4.tar</tt> which
might extract as follows:</p>

<p><pre><tt>$ tar xvf jschauma-HW4.tar
jschauma
jschauma/Makefile
jschauma/README
jschauma/aed.c
$</tt></pre></p>

<p> The due date for this assignment is 2015-11-30 20:45. Please attach
the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt> email address to
<a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631]
HW4">jschauma@stevens.edu</a> with a subject of "[CS631] HW4".</p>
