All assignments given in the class CS631 Advanced Programming in the UNIX
Environment must be submitted as plain ASCII text files.  Plain text is
the most portable and ubiquitous format; no special tools are required to
read it, all Unix tools can process it, and all formatting is fixed and
guaranteed to be the same across systems.  Plain text makes no assumptions
about the abilities of the system on which it is read.

However, it appears that students are not used to writing plain text and
often tend to use word processors, end up writing HTML or XML documents,
or submit PDF files.  None of this is necessary, even for long and complex
documents.  If plain text is good enough for RFCs, it is good enough for
your homework submissions in this class.

However, to ensure that the content of the documents you write is easy to
read, please follow the recommendations below:

- Just like with code, readability is important!

- Use a Unix text editor on a Unix(-like) system.

  It is essential to be able to efficiently use a text editor, and doing
  all your writing / coding / text processing in one of the common editors
  available on all Unix systems is good practice.  vi(1)/vim(1) and emacs(1)
  are popular choices.

- Break your lines at around 76 characters.  Longer lines are harder to
  read.

- Use paragraphs.  Text that is all written in one large block without any
  paragraphs is very hard to read.  Give your text (and reader) some room
  to breath.

- Spell-check your text before submitting it.  On my Unix-like systems,
  you can find the ispell(1) command installed.

- Re-read your text before submitting it.  Sometimes it is useful to take
  some time in between finishing writing your text and actually submitting
  it.  Giving your brain a break will let you find mistakes or identify
  possible improvements.
