        <H3>HW#2: code reading</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to get used to
	read (and understand!) code that you did not write yourself.
	To this end, you are to compare two implementations of the
	<tt>stat(1)</tt> command: the
	<a
href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/stat/stat.c?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&only_with_tag=MAIN">NetBSD version</a> and the version
	of GNU <tt>stat(1)</tt> found in the GNU
	<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/">coreutils</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Carefully read
	the different implementations, the consider what they
	have in common, what makes them different, what may be of interest
	in either implementation.
	</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a single <a href="text">plain text file</a> created with a unix
	text editor on a unix system called "HW2-&lt;username&gt;" (where
	"&lt;username&gt;" is your Stevens username).  In
	that file write down (<em>in proper English, spell-checked and with
	valid grammar</em>) your findings.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: we are not looking for a line-by-line comparison stating
	that one file has 30 lines of comments while another has 32.
	Focus on how the different implementations solved the same
	problem.  If there are notable differences, comment on what the
	reasons for the differences might be.
	</p>
	<p>
	The due date for this assignment is 2017-09-25 16:00.  Please
	attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
	email address to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] HW2">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS631] HW2".
